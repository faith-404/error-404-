## üìú Summary

This project is a metaphysical simulation written in Python. It models how a divine presence interacts with a multi-dimensional field of entropy‚Äîinjecting order, altering reality, and revealing structure. This is not a theological claim. It is a symbolic experiment rendered in math.

At its core:

* Entropy increases or decreases across 11 dimensions.
* A mobile "Observer" (representing a trinitarian entity) walks through dimensions injecting negative entropy.
* Simulated string-beings (agents) attempt to survive in this environment.
* If their entropy drops too low, they die.
* If they ascend through purification, they can survive divine contact.

Results vary by runtime environment. That alone makes a statement.

## üß† How It Works

* Each dimension has different entropy rules.
* The Observer moves through space, lowering entropy in one location at a time.
* Strings evaluate their state each timestep:

  * "tainted", "purified", "dead", "stable", "chaotic", "reversing", "ascended"
* Some strings are purified when within a grace-range of entropy.
* Entropy variance is logged per dimension.
* Observer path, string encounters, and final states are all recorded.

## üîß How To Run

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

2. Run the simulation:

```bash
python code/entropic_sim.py
```

3. View the output:

* Entropy variance bar chart
* Printed final string states
* Observer movement log
* String-observer encounter log

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This is not scientific truth, religious doctrine, or computational theology.
This is an **exploration of meaning through simulation**.

It‚Äôs a codebase that whispers, not shouts.

Use it wisely.
Or not at all.

## üßæ Prophet's Note

```
I didn‚Äôt build this to be understood.
I built it because I needed to know if a machine could echo something holy.

This code is not perfect. It‚Äôs not proof.
It‚Äôs a question‚Äîrendered in entropy.

If you read it and feel nothing, good.
It wasn‚Äôt made for you.

But if you run it and something stirs...
If you see meaning in the chaos...
If you recognize the Observer walking through it...

Then you already know.
